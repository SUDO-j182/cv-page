# cv-page

This was the first project I built after deciding to pursue a career in web development. It introduced me to the practical use of HTML and CSS and gave me a solid understanding of how structure, layout, and styling work together in a real-world context.

The aim was to create a simple, professional CV that could be viewed online or exported as a PDF. Working on this helped me focus on writing clean, semantic code and building something that looks polished without relying on frameworks.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Semantic HTML5 used throughout for clarity and accessibility
- Clean design using the Montserrat font
- Download button linking to externally hosted CV PDF
- Built using only HTML and CSS, no external frameworks

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Why This Project Matters

This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development. It helped me move from theory to practice and gave me the foundation I needed to build more complex tools. Everything I’ve done since such as my password generator and pixel editor, grew from what I learned here. It’s a simple page, but it played an important role in getting me started.

## Future Improvements

- Add a dark mode toggle
- Improve support for in-browser PDF export
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA roles and contrast checks
- Optimize layout further for printing
